# 1.3.9.1 -> 1.3.9.2

- Fixes regression: NPE thrown for projects only applying the *java-base* plugin. (e.g. for LibGDX projects)
- Fixes regression: Running tests from the the tested class (not the test class) does not run the tests.
- Enabling all features of the Groovy integration of NetBeans for projects applying the *groovy* plugin.
- Performace improvement: Debugger should start faster in some cases. See [Issue/netbeans.org 267969](https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267969).
- New API: Added utility classes to create model builders via reflection.
- Prevents some unnecessary project model load for unopened projects.
- The class path of .gradle files now contain the jars inside *lib/plugins* directory of Gradle.
- Workaround for issues when non-proxy hosts are specified. See [issue #139](https://github.com/kelemen/netbeans-gradle-project/issues/139).

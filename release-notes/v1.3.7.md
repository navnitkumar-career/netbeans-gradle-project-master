# 1.3.6 -> 1.3.7

- Improved handling of non-default root projects.
- Project view icons now have an "opened" version.
- Sources can now be grouped by source sets.
- Fixes NPE when displaying the global settings using GTK Look and Feel.
- JavaFX files can now be added in the add new file dialog.
- Fixes regression: Project wizards will create invalid files when Change Line Endings on Save plugin is not installed.
- New extension API: Other NetBeans plugins might define additional arguments passed to Gradle.
- Reduced the number of (unnecessary) class path scanning requests.
- Improved the detection of test outputs for custom test tasks (Issue #200).
- Fixed an NPE when opening the stack trace node in the test results window.
- Fixed input provided to Gradle (via the standard input) when using unicode characters requiring more than one byte in UTF-16.
- Working around a Gradle bug which prevents forwarding input to standard input (unless you close the input stream) on Windows. The workaround replaces LF characters with CR LF on Windows (can be turned off in the global settings).

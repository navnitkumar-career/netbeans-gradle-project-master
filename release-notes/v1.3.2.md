# 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2

- When using Gradle 2.1 or later, the build can now be cancelled clicking on the small "x" on the task progress bar. There might be a few seconds timeout before cancellation.
- When using Gradle 2.1 or later, unattaching the debugger now cancels the build (killing the debuggee process). There might be a few seconds timeout before cancellation.
- Fixes [Issue #152](https://github.com/kelemen/netbeans-gradle-project/issues/152)

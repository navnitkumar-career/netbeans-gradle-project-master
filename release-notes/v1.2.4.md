# 1.2.2 -> 1.2.4

- Added a public API to allow other projects to extend the functionality of the plugin. The first plugin which is integrated is [NBAndroid](http://www.nbandroid.org). Note however, that the new API is only usable for projects using Gradle 1.6 or later. Also, the support is rather experimental for every participant (This plugin, NBAndroid, Android build system and Gradle itself).
- NetBeans classpath scanning should no longer interfere with the clean task.
- Custom task variables can now be defined in the custom tasks dialog. These variables will be requested from the user in a pop-up dialog before executing the task. See the [wiki page (Custom Task Variables)](https://github.com/kelemen/netbeans-gradle-project/wiki/Custom-Task-Variables) for details about this new feature.
- Fixed a possible issue with refactoring across multiple opened projects (In previous releases, it was possible, that some opened projects were not considered for refactoring).
- Regression: [Issue #25](https://github.com/kelemen/netbeans-gradle-project/issues/25) is reintroduced as a side effect of providing a public API.

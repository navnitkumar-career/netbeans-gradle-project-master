# 1.2.1 -> 1.2.2

- Fixed a possible dead-lock when refactoring ([Issue/netbeans.org 228494](https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=228494) and [Issue #37](https://github.com/kelemen/netbeans-gradle-project/issues/37))
- The display name of the project is now the one specified in the build script (only after the project has been loaded).

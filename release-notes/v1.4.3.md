# 1.4.2 -> 1.4.3

**This version might break some plugins depending on this plugin. You must use 1.4.2 to keep using those plugins or ask their author to update.**.

- Recognizes "error" and "warning" lines with file paths in the output window as links.
- Show the version number of Gradle as the plugin sees it in JDK selection combo boxes (rather than just the display name).
- Print the version of Gradle used to execute a task (opt-in: must be configured in the global settings).
- Fixed some Gradle API usage deprecated for Gradle 5.0.

# 1.3.5 -> 1.3.6

- Fixes regression: Sometimes the run/debug/generate javadoc commands are disabled for no reason.
- Fixes regression: Project wizards will create invalid files when the line ending is not LF.
- Executing debug tasks via Ctrl+F11 no longer cancels the build immediately.
- Root project in custom locations are now supported. For this feature to work, you have to keep the root project open. (Note: If you have multiple root projects open for a single subproject, NetBeans will pick one at random).
- New task variable: ${env.MY_ENV_VAR} where "MY_ENV_VAR" can be any environment variable and the task variable will be replaced by the value of the given environment variable.

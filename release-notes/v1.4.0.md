# 1.3.9.2 -> 1.4.0

- Dependency node distinguishes between dependencies on different source sets of the same project.
- Greatly reduced memory consumption for large projects.
- The user is notified if the project cache is too small to work efficiently.
- Some new file templates are now enabled.
- Fixes an NPE when deleting some output directories while the plugin is checking that directory.
- Project dependency handling is now more clever: When you reload a project, all project dependening on it (even unopened ones) should refresh their state.
- When using the composite build feature of Gradle, dependencies are recognized as project dependencies.
- New subprojects added to a multi-project build should no longer require an explicit reload of the root project.
- A project with Kotlin based build script is recognized as a Gradle project.
- Adding the same directory as source root multiple times with different filters should be displayed properly.
- Improved cooperation with some plugin (QuickOpener in particular).
- Subprojects nodes now have a context menu containing everything a project node has (meaning that you don't have to open a project simply to run a task).
- You can now use environment variables in specifying the location of Gradle in the form of *${env.MY_VARIABLE}*.

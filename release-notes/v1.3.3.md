# 1.3.2 -> 1.3.3

- **Warning**: Using Gradle 2.3 is not fully supported by this plugin (there will be some feature loss) due to a Gradle bug (already fixed in Gradle). Regardless, this version of this plugin will try its best to load the project. (Issue #178)
- Skipped tests are no longer displayed as failures with newer versions of Gradle. (Issue #167)
- If there are no sources for a dependency but there is a javadoc artifact (and the idea plugin of Gradle is configured to download them), the javadoc artifact is used to display the javadoc (rather than nothing). (Issue #179)
- Only links are underlined in the output window, not the whole line (consequently, multiple links might appear in a single line). (Issue #164)
- NetBeans will now be less eager to fully load projects when they are not needed.
- Exclude and include rules of source directory sets. (Issue #184)
- NetBeans should now show source files found in directories excluded from VCS. (Issue #132)
- When a project has many Gradle tasks, they are automatically grouped in the project's context menu. (Issue #104)

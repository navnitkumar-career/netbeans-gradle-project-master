# 1.1.2 -> 1.1.3

- When debugging test code, the sources are added to the classpath as well as the sources of the tests.
- Fixed a possible issue which could lead NetBeans to a class cast error.
- Directories containing a "settings.gradle" are also recognized as Gradle projects.
- Directories containing a .gradle file with the same name as its containing directory are also recognized as Gradle projects.
- It is now possible to specify that a Gradle task is "non-blocking". Non-blocking tasks will not be attempted to run concurrently and newly submitted tasks will wait for previously submitted non-blocking tasks to complete. This is to avoid starting multiple Gradle daemons when it is not necessary. Most built-in tasks are marked as non-blocking, the exceptions are debug and run tasks.
- Fixed a possible NPE, if a Java platform is added to NetBeans which do not have a specification version.
- The name of the target platform is saved to the project properties file. This is to avoid confusing different kind of platforms.

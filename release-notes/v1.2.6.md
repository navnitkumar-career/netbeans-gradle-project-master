# 1.2.5 -> 1.2.6

- Gradle 1.7 is now the default when no version is specified (neither in the project properties nor in the global settings).
- Fixed a bug where fully qualified tasks might not always found. This matters only if  "tasks must exist" is checked.
- The tasks in custom Gradle commands are now detected properly even if a custom task variable containing space character is used.
- Fixed a bug where the plugin sometimes failed to use the Gradle version set in the project properties.
- Fixed a problem when converting printed stack traces to links to the source code.
- If you use "[directory-name].gradle" instead of the default "build.gradle", it is treated the same way as "build.gradle" everywhere.

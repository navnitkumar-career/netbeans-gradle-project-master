# 1.1.8 -> 1.1.9

- Where you can specify the installation of Gradle, you can now specify an url of a zip file containing the Gradle distribution (e.g.: by writing "?DIST=http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.3-bin.zip")
- Where you can specify the installation of Gradle, you can now specify the version instead (e.g.:  by writing "?VER=1.3")
- New global property: It is now possible to set a different user home directory for Gradle (this is "~/.gradle" by default).
- Better detection of changes of unopened projects when reloading a project.
- Debug Single and Debug Test Single tasks are considered "blocking" by default.
- New project property: Java platform for executing build scripts (i.e.: it is now possible to set different one for each project).
- New project property: Installation directory of Gradle (i.e.: it is now possible to set different one for each project).
- Test single is allowed for Groovy files as well.
- It is now possible to write data for the build script to read when running tasks. Note however that due to a Gradle bug (in Gradle 1.3), the input is only forwarded after the input is closed (Ctrl+D is pressed in the output window).

# 1.4.0 -> 1.4.1

- Fixed project loading when using Gradle 4.0 and configure on demand.
- Fixed a possible issue where project dependencies are not properly detected when loading a project while it is not built.
- Fixes a possible bug when referencing files with UNC paths in the build script.
- Enabled compiling single file in the context menu of source files (it will run the classes task by default).
- Automatically detecting if source roots are created outside the IDE.
- Compile on save action will no longer trigger concurrently with other non-blocking tasks.
- No longer showing .gradle directory as a build script under the build script node.
- Improved the detection of links to files in the output window (i.e., detecting files from other subprojects as well).
- Support for custom JVM argument configuration for the Run/Debug command.
